										<h2>10 Simple Beauty Tips For Hands</h2>
										<span class="byline"> body care tips </span>
									</header>
									<p>Since our hands are used to carry out most of the chores, they need the pampering and relaxing to look nice and smooth! Listed are ten sure shot ways to get those beautiful looking hands</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p><h1>1. Moisturise your hands:</h1> 
                                    
                                    <p><h1>2. Pamper the hands:</h1><p>Indulge in a manicure at least once a month. With a manicure you hands get cleaned, exfoliated and massaged. It is thorough nourishment that your hands get.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>3. Wash your hands:</h1><p>When you wash your hands, ensure that you wash your hands in lukewarm water all year round. Too hot water or too cold water tends to damage the skin. Never use normal dish soap because it is harsh on the skin and it also dries the skin easily.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>4. Scrub:</h1><p>Scrub your hands at least once a week with a good exfoliating agent to get rid of any dead skin. No time to buy one? Make one at home. Take a teaspoon each of fine sugar and olive oil and mix it well with the juice of half a lime. If you want to try something different, add one drop of your favourite EO and you are done! You have your home made exfoliating scrub ready.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>5. Massage:</h1><p>Massage your hands at night for at least five minutes to let the goodness of the moisturiser soak in. For very rough hands, mix your moisturiser with a bit of Vaseline so that they are protected all through the night.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>6. Protect your hands:</h1><p>When you are washing dishes, gardening or carrying out any chore that allows your hand to interact with chemicals, grease or dirt, ensure that you are wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>7. File and Trim:</h1><p>When you file your nails, file them in one direction rather than a seesaw action. A seesaw action can separate the layers of the nail and if water finds its way between those nail layers, it can lead to nail peeling. Trim your nails at least once in two weeks or as required.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>8. Paint your nails:</h1><p>TWhen you paint your nails, always use a base coat so that your nails are not stained. Using a base-coat will also help the nail-polish last longer.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>9. Protect your cuticles:</h1><p>TUse a good quality cuticle cream or oil to prevent the cuticles from roughing out or drying. Looking for an alternative you can do at home? Apply a few drops of glycerine to your hands overnight at least twice a week and wash off with lukewarm water in the morning. You will wake up with softer hands.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>10. Eat right:</h1><p>What you eat is very important. Proteins, Vitamin B, Vitamin E supplements should be a part of your diet to get healthy, strong nails and to keep your hands supple and soft.</p><br/><br/><br/>

									<p>8 expert tips to get rid of dry, itchy skin</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p><h1>1. Avoid using bar soap or high-foaming body washes.</h1><p>The body has far fewer oil glands than that of the face and the ones that you do have decrease with age, making it more difficult to stay moist. Due to the high pH of bar soaps and highly foaming body washes, these can be very stripping to the skin and make dryness and itchiness worse. A safer option is to use a non-drying, low-foaming shower gel. Look for ones that are creamy in consistency and say ‘sulfate-free’ on the bottle. Avoid the ingredients Sodium Laureth Sulfate or Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, as these only further damage the skin is barrier.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>2. Use a humidifier.</h1><p>Whenever the air is dry and moisture is not present, the air draws moisture from wherever it can (through a process called osmosis). Especially in the winter, it will take it directly from your skin. Using a humidifier helps counteract the dryness in the air so moisture is less likely to evaporate. Here are three more reasons to use a humidifier in the winter.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>3. Exfoliate the skin gently twice a week.</h1><p>Gently dissolving and removing surface dry, flaky skin cells will not only make the skin look smoother and feel softer but when body lotion or oil is applied after, it will penetrate deeper into the skin. Exfoliation is based on the ‘out with the old and in with the new’ concept and will help repair the skin’s moisture barrier.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>4. Use a body lotion or oil both morning and night, but choose one with barrier-repairing ingredients.</h1><p>Not all moisturizing ingredients are equal, but the ones below are some of the most effective for repairing dry, itchy skin: Borage Oil, Bois De Rose Oil, Carrot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Cranberry Oil, Ceramides,Linoleic/Linolenic Acids, Squalane, Linoleic Acid, Tocopheryl Linoleate, Phytosterols, Shea Butter, Sunflower Oil, Soybean Oil, Safflower Oil, Jojoba Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Canola Oil and Sesame Seed Oil </p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>5. Avoid tight clothing with scratchy fibers.</h1><p>I know for me, itchiness occurs on my hips where my clothes are the tightest. The rubbing when I move around adds to the irritation and causes my skin to itch like crazy. Even though I don’t have visible dryness in this area, it is still a sign of a damaged moisture barrier, so I have to treat this area by regularly exfoliating and moisturizing. Fabrics like wool can add to skin irritation so it’s best to wear cotton, silk or smooth fabrics next to the skin.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>6. Avoid using the shower fan.</h1><p>During the winter when the heat is on in the house, it can create an exceptionally dry environment. When the air is dry it seeks moisture and steals it from wherever it is available. After taking a warm shower or bath, the moisture collects and hangs in the air. Avoid running your bathroom fan or vent to eliminate the steam. Instead, allow the humidity to linger. This will encourage the moisture to remain in the air, which will keep your skin comfortably hydrated. Be sure to apply a body lotion or oil immediately after you get out of the shower or bath.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>7. Eat foods that contain “good fats.”</h1><p>Almonds, salmon, sardines, avocados, walnuts and olive oil all contain fatty acids that keep the skin moist from the inside out. Consider taking an Evening Primrose supplement to offer additional comfort for dry, itchy skin.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>8. When all else fails, apply a cortisone cream.</h1><p>JFor itchiness, applying a non-prescription, topical 1% cortisone cream in place of a body lotion can provide anti-inflammatory relief. You can also mix this in with a body lotion before applying it to the skin.</p><br/><br/><br/>

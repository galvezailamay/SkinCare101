                                    <p><h1>1. Clean Your Skin Using an Oil-Based Lotion</h1><p>This is not usually the first thing that comes to mind for oily skin, but skin needs to be well hydrated. If it isn't, it will compensate by making more oil. Remove your makeup with a cleansing oil before using a more conventional cleansing method.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>2. Don't Wash Your Face in the Evening</h1><p>You may have heard that water can't do any damage. Or maybe you’ve heard that washing your face twice a day can help remove traces of oil and blocked pores. Wrong! Your skin might overreact. Clean your face with only water in the evening and add a little soap or a gentle cleanser to remove makeup and excess oil. In the morning, just spray a toner.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>3. Avoid Moisturizing Masks and Oily Products</h1><p>This is a tricky balance. On one hand, we have to retain the skin's natural hydration, but on the other, we shouldn’t use too many oily products. Opt for a non-oily moisturizer and foundation. They will not block pores and will make your skin look fresher. Look for products classified as “noncomedogenic” — meaning they don’t clog pores. Clogged pores can lead to formation of blackheads, so it is absolutely necessary you use “noncomedogenic” products. You could also use natural ingredients to remove blackheads. </p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>4. Every Morning</h1><p>If you have blotchy skin, exfoliating every morning can work miracles. If your skin is sensitive, do not exfoliate more than once a week. Use a product or gentle glove that is made especially for the face. Avoid products that are too grainy, which can create microscopic cracks in the skin. Opt for an exfoliator with synthetic, perfectly round grains.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>5. Don’t Cross Contaminate</h1><p>The products that we put on our hair are fantastic for hair, but they can sometimes cause small zits on acne-prone skin. If you have long hair, put it in a ponytail before you go to bed so that your face doesn't lie on your hair. Change your pillowcases as often as possible: You don’t want any oil or skin cells on the fabric to build up and be in constant contact with your face.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h1>6. Always Use a Clean Towel to Dry Your Face</h1><p>Your family might think you are a diva, but it doesn't matter! Only use clean towels to dry your face. It doesn't matter whether you use cloth or paper towels. The main thing is that they are clean. The towel that you used for the rest of your body contains traces of oils, lotions and soaps. This is not a problem if you reuse it for your body, but it can cause problems if you rub it on your face.</p><br/><br/><br/>

									<p> Are you struggling with oily skin? Do not know what skincare products suit your skin type? Not to worry, here are some tips and tricks for treating your oily skin without losing its natural glow and sheen. It is a common misconception that moisturizers are used for treating only dry skin. Moisturizers are even needed by oily skin. They improve skin texture, protect oily skin and mask imperfections. But before using a moisturizer, it is important to understand your skin type. If you are suffering from oily skin, washing away the face every time causes the skin to produce more oil. As a result, the skin looks dull and lifeless. This can add a lot of frustration.

                                    <p> <strong>Reasons to Care for Oily Skin:</strong><p>Washing face can be a simple solution but it is only temporary. You just can’t get rid of the oil completely. Oily skin needs more care and attention because the pores are large and open. This attracts more dust and dirt and leads to acne breakouts and blemishes. The end result is ugly and lifeless skin. Also, the thick sebum layer that forms on the skin due to excess oil production makes the need for hydration redundant. This makes the skin lack moisture and the pores clogged with oil.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Choosing the Best Water Based Moisturizer for Oily Skin:</strong><p>The first thing to keep in mind for choosing the best moisturizer is to understand your skin type. Many moisturizers are high in oil content and can make your skin look worse. This will add more problems than solving it. Water based moisturizers are the best for oily skin as they contain very less oil. A water based moisturizer makes the product light and does not clog the pores. It is good to check the oil label on moisturizers. You should always avoid mineral oils in moisturizers. Water based moisturizers with oil control, SPF, hydroxyl acids and glycerin work best for your skin. Now that you know the moisturizer that best suits our skin, it is simpler to choose the one that fits your budget. Just walk into any store, pick one of these moisturizers and take on the world with your clear and glowing skin. And, please do not forget to share your feedback! We would love to hear from you. </p><br/><br/><br/>
